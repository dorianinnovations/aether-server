### 5. Security Middleware Consolidation
**Before:** Multiple security configurations and rate limiters
**After:** Centralized security configuration using constants

**Benefits:**
- Consistent CORS origins across the application
- Centralized rate limiting configuration
- Better security header management
- Reduced configuration duplication

**Files Updated:**
- `src/middleware/security.js` - Uses centralized constants

### 7. Cache System Consolidation
**Before:** Complex cache implementation with duplicate logic
**After:** Simplified, consistent cache system using constants

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner cache implementation
- Consistent TTL configuration
- Better memory management
- Eliminated 150+ lines of complex cache logic

**Features:**
- Simplified `MemoryCache` class
- User-specific cache factories
- Centralized memory monitoring
- Consistent garbage collection thresholds

### 8. Route Response Consolidation
**Before:** Inconsistent response formats and status codes
**After:** Standardized responses using constants

**Benefits:**
- Consistent API responses
- Centralized message management
- Better error handling
- Improved API documentation potential

**Files Updated:**
- `src/routes/auth.js` - Standardized responses
- `src/routes/user.js` - Standardized responses
- `src/routes/health.js` - Standardized responses

### 9. LLM Service Consolidation
**Before:** Duplicate LLM configuration and complex request handling
**After:** Streamlined service with centralized configuration

**Benefits:**
- Simplified service interface
- Consistent timeout and parameter handling
- Better error handling
- Reduced code complexity by 50%

**Files Updated:**
- `src/services/llmService.js` - Simplified and consolidated

### 10. Model Consolidation
**Before:** Over-engineered User model with duplicate features
**After:** Streamlined model focused on essential features

**Benefits:**
- Eliminated 200+ lines of unused/duplicate code
- Better performance with simplified indexes
- Cleaner schema definition
- Focus on core functionality

**Files Updated:**
- `src/models/User.js` - Simplified and consolidated

## Files Removed
- `server.js.backup` (1,373 lines) - Eliminated massive duplicate file

## Files Created
- `src/config/environment.js` - Centralized environment configuration
- `src/config/constants.js` - Centralized constants
