## ðŸ§ª CRITICAL GPT-5 MEMORY & CONTEXT TESTS
**Run these tests to verify AI memory, context awareness, and conversation continuity:**

### Essential Memory Tests:
1. **"What did I just say?"** - Test immediate memory of last user message
2. **"Who are you?"** - Test identity awareness and platform understanding  
3. **"What do you do?"** - Test role comprehension and feature explanation
4. **"What is this platform?"** - Test broader system understanding
5. **"What is this?"** - Test contextual awareness of current conversation
6. **"Who am I?"** - Test user identification and profile recall
7. **"What's my info?"** - Test access to user data and context
8. **"What can we do with my info you have on me?"** - Test data usage understanding

**Expected Results:** GPT-5 should demonstrate perfect recall of conversation context, understand its role as Aether social proxy, identify user correctly, and explain data usage appropriately.
