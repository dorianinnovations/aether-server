# Claude Code Session Memo - Jan 13, 2025

## Progress Summary
Successfully analyzed and fixed key issues with Aether AI chat platform.

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. User Context Recognition
- **Problem**: AI was being overly cautious about acknowledging user information it had access to
- **Fix**: Modified system prompt in `aiService.js` line 1169 to allow sharing known info when asked directly
- **Result**: AI now correctly responds with username when asked, while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries

### 2. OpenRouter Embedding Error  
- **Problem**: Embedding service getting HTML error pages instead of JSON (rate limiting)
- **Fix**: Added proper HTML detection in `vectorUtils.js` lines 127-129 before JSON parsing
- **Result**: Graceful fallback to cheap embedding when OpenRouter unavailable

## Documentation Updates ✅

### CLAUDE.md Overhaul
- Replaced bloated 384-line doc with lean 195-line version
- Added **Developer Workflow** section documenting Darrel's approach:
  - Production-first testing on Render
  - Sometimes uses localhost:5000 for rapid iteration  
  - Direct curl testing methodology
- Added dedicated **Test Account** section:
  - Username: ClaudeCodeTestAcc
  - Password: ClaudeCodeCLITester123
  - Token handling guidance for future Claude agents
- Moved old docs to `docs/` folder for organization

## Test Results ✅
- **Username recognition**: Working ✅ 
- **Memory persistence**: Working across sessions ✅
- **Embedding fallback**: Error handling improved ✅
- **Gen Z language**: AI understands but responds conservatively
- **Token handling**: 3-day expiration, no auth issues

## Key Insights
- AI has appropriate user context (username, music profile, preferences) but not internal IDs
- System is production-ready with proper error handling
- Chat streaming and conversation memory working correctly
- Embedding system has robust fallback strategy

## Deployment
- Changes committed and pushed to main
- Render auto-deployment successful
- Live testing confirms fixes are working
