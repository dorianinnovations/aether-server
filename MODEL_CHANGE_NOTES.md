# Model Change: Claude 3 Sonnet â†’ GPT-4o

## Changes Made

### Core LLM Service (`src/services/llmService.js`)
- **Model**: Changed from `anthropic/claude-3-sonnet` to `openai/gpt-4o`
- **Default Temperature**: Increased from `0.7` to `0.8` (GPT-4o performs better with slightly higher creativity)
- **Default Max Tokens**: Increased from `300` to `500` (GPT-4o can handle longer responses more efficiently)
- **Stop Tokens**: Removed Claude-specific stop tokens (`["<|im_end|>", "\n<|im_start|>"]`) as GPT-4o doesn't require them

### Health Check Updates (`src/routes/health.js`)
- Updated service name references from "OpenRouter (Claude 3 Sonnet)" to "OpenRouter (GPT-4o)"

### Personalized AI System Prompts (`src/routes/personalizedAI.js`)
- Enhanced system prompts to leverage GPT-4o's superior reasoning capabilities
- Added GPT-4o specific instructions for advanced pattern recognition
- Optimized response guidelines for GPT-4o's strengths in logical reasoning and creativity
- Adjusted temperature to `0.8` for better creative and insightful responses

### New Test Endpoints (`src/routes/testGPT4o.js`)
- `/test-gpt4o/test-gpt4o` - Basic GPT-4o functionality test
- `/test-gpt4o/test-gpt4o-stream` - Streaming response test
- `/test-gpt4o/test-gpt4o-temperatures` - Temperature variation testing
- `/test-gpt4o/gpt4o-health` - GPT-4o specific health check

## GPT-4o Advantages Over Claude 3 Sonnet

- Improved pattern recognition and analysis

### 2. **Better Instruction Following**
- More precise adherence to complex system prompts
- Better handling of structured output requirements
- Improved consistency in response formatting

### 3. **Enhanced Creativity**
- Better creative synthesis of information
- More nuanced metaphors and analogies
- Improved storytelling and narrative capabilities

### 4. **Improved Context Handling**
- Better understanding of complex conversational context
- More sophisticated handling of historical references
- Enhanced ability to maintain consistency across long conversations

### 5. **Optimized Performance**
- Faster response times for complex queries
- Better token efficiency
- More stable streaming responses

## Testing the Change

### Basic Functionality Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test-gpt4o/test-gpt4o \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello GPT-4o, please introduce yourself and demonstrate your capabilities."}'
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/test-gpt4o/gpt4o-health
```

### Personalized Chat Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/personalized-ai/contextual-chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about any historical patterns I might be reliving this week"}'
```

## Expected Improvements

### 1. **Historical References**
- More accurate and nuanced historical parallels
- Better cultural context integration
- Enhanced ability to connect personal patterns to historical events

### 2. **Personalized Insights**
- More sophisticated behavioral pattern analysis
- Better synthesis of user data into actionable insights
- Enhanced prediction capabilities

### 3. **User Connections**
- More nuanced compatibility analysis
- Better understanding of personality dynamics
- Improved connection recommendations

### 4. **Real-time Processing**
- More efficient data pattern recognition
- Better emotional state analysis
- Enhanced real-time recommendation generation

## Monitoring and Validation

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Response Quality**: Check for improved insight depth and accuracy
2. **User Engagement**: Monitor conversation length and user satisfaction
3. **Historical Reference Accuracy**: Validate historical context relevance
4. **Personalization Effectiveness**: Track recommendation acceptance rates
5. **System Performance**: Monitor response times and error rates

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, revert by:
1. Change model back to `"anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"` in `llmService.js`
2. Restore previous temperature settings (`0.7`)
3. Restore previous token limits (`300`)
4. Update health check service names
5. Revert system prompt optimizations if needed

## Environment Variables
No changes to environment variables required. The same `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` works with both models.

## Cost Considerations
- GPT-4o may have different pricing than Claude 3 Sonnet
- Monitor OpenRouter usage and costs
- The improved efficiency may offset any cost differences
